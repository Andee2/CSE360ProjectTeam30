• Andee's idea 
• RPG - Similar to Knights of Pen and Paper
• Start off as Warrior, Mage, Archer etc.
• Battle with creatures
• 3 rounds with 3 creatures 
• Dice rolls let you choose what abilities you can use
	○ 3-4 dice rolls - roll beforehand, each number is an ability and you can reroll for a penalty 
	○ Ex. 6 - power attack, 2 - kick
	○ No healing
• How would we grade it? 
	○ Survival mode?

Marc's Idea
• Dice games are usually games of chance
	○ Need to be in person to affect odds normally
• Similar to craps where you can pick which number you want and earn points based on probability
• Whoever has highest points at end wins
• Can kind of effect outcome by picking lower or higher odds
• Too similar to craps, might be able to put Andee's idea on it and spin it into a RPG


Jessie's Idea
• Similar to the board game RISK
• Separate turns between set up units and battle
