Dice Game Project for CSE360

Quick Start:
For new players, begin by creating a profile using a name of your choice. After successfully creating a profile, click "Start
Fight." On the new screen is a drop down box to select a number between 2 and 12. Once a selection is made, the opponent will
also make a guess followed by two six-sided dice being rolled. The objective of the game is to guess what number will be
rolled more accurately than the opponent can. In the event both player and opponent are an equal distance from the correct
number, the player will win the round. The player will face three separate opponents for three rounds each.

The Plot:
A goblin army has appeared on the boarders of your kingdom and the numbers are not in your favor. Thier fleet of soldiers out
numbers the capabilities of your people. However you recognize their banners and recall that their supreme comander is a 
sucker for a good gamble. After appealling to his gambling addictions, and threatening to use scortched-earth tactics, you
convince the supreme commander to take on a bet. You wager your unconditional surrender and he wagers an oath to leave your
kindom and return home. A pair of six-sided dice are brought out to the tabel where the negotations were being held. Now you
must gamble against the supreme commander and his top two generals.
